  <h1>3.2.1 input Type color</h1>
  <p>The color input type (Fig. 3.1; lines 20&ndash;21) enables the user to enter a color.
     Opera displays a color picker control that shows the default color
     (black) with a down arrow that, when clicked, shows a drop&ndash;down with
     20 basic colors (Fig. 3.2). The user can select a color or click the Other...
     button to select from additional basic colors or create
     a custom color. At the time of this writing, most browsers render the color input type as a
     text field in which the user can enter a hexadecimal code.</p>

      <h2>autofocus Attribute</h2>
      <p>The autofocus attribute (Fig. 3.1; line 20)&ndash;an optional attribute that can be
          used in only one input element on a form&ndash;automatically
          gives the focus to the input element, allowing the user to begin typing in that
          element immediately. Figure 3.3 shows autofocus on the color element&ndash;the
          first input element in our form&ndash;as rendered
          in Chrome. You do not need to include autofocus in your forms.</p>

      <h2>Validation</h2>
      <p>Traditionally it's been difficult to validate user input, such as ensuring that an
         e&ndash;mail address, URL, date or time is entered in the proper format. The new HTML 5
         input types are self validating on the client side, eliminating the need to add
         complicated JavaScript code to your web pages to validate user input, reducing
         the amount of invalid data submitted and consequently reducing Internet traffic
         between the server and the client to correct invalid input.</p>

      <p>When a user enters data into a form then submits the form (in this example, by clicking
         the Submit button), the browser immediately checks the self-validating elements to
         ensure that the data is correct. For example, if a user enters an incorrect
         hexadecimal color value when using a browser that renders the color elements as a
         text field (e.g., Chrome), a callout pointing to the element will appear, indicating
         that an invalid value was entered (Fig. 3.4). Figure 3.5 lists each of the new HTML5
         input types and provides examples of the proper formats required for each type of data to
         be valid.</p>
